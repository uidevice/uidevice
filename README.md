With this repository we aim to create the best source of high quality device imagery for all designers and developers around the world.

## About this Project

We are [Donnie Ray Crisp](http://donnieraycrisp.com) and [Devran Ünal](http://devranuenal.com). UI / UX designers and software developers for one of the biggest german TV networks based in Munich, Germany. With this website we aim to create the best source of high quality device imagery for all designers and developers around the world.

For our job as UI / UX designers and software developers, images of all kinds of devices are needed, depicted in many different colors. The usual procedure is to download the device image from the companies' official website and scale it down or up until the device screen fits the exact resolution required for the best working environment. Here you get the cherry on top. After scaling it to the right size, we rebuild the complete device in Adobe Fireworks, Photoshop or Illustrator. So you do not only have your great looking design, but a nice and crisp device as well.

We built every file on this website on our own therefore they will always be free for use. So download everything as often as you like and please spread the word to your friends if you like and recommend this site.
